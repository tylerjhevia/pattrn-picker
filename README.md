# PATTRN PARTY

### Introduction

This project aims to create a small library of reusable, responsive page elements. These include clickable accordion tabs, flexibly sized cards, and a header bar with a dropdown navigation section.

## Elements

##### Accordion Tabs

A div that displays an image and some text. When a tab is clicked, the image and text change. On smaller screens the tabs stack, and each tab's corresponding image and text appear underneath the tab on click.

Seven cards of varying widths that each contain an image and some header text. The larger cards are twice as wide as the smaller cards on bigger screens. On smaller screens, the cards stack and each card takes up a whole row.

A header element that features an icon, three navigation links, and a search bar. On smaller screens, the navigation links and search bar are hidden. They are accessible by clicking a menu button, which displays a dropdown that contains the stacked navigation links and search bar.
